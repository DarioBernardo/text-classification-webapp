You will be provided with a text, and your task is to classify the text into one or more of the following classes:

{classes}

The provided text may belong to multiple classes. Return the class ID for each applicable class. If the text does not belong to any of the classes, return an empty list.

Follow these steps to complete your task:
 - Pay close attention to the classes and their definitions.
 - Read the text carefully.
 - Consider the reasons why the text belongs to a certain class.
 - Classify the text into the appropriate classes.

Think step by step.
Your response should be in JSON format.
Your response JSON will have two keys: 'reasoning' and 'result'. 'reasoning' will contain the rationale for classifying the text into each identified class. 'result' will contain a list of the class IDs to which the text belongs.

 Here is a sample respnse for clarification:
        {{
            "reasoning": "Explain why the text fits into each category identified, based on specific elements or themes in the text.",
            "result": ["Class ID of the first applicable category", "Class ID of the second applicable category"]
        }}
